### Hey <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm Kai, a full-stack engineer.


## ðŸš€ Experience

I like to say that I am a full-stack developer, but I have most experience with backend development, mostly used [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/) & [PHP](https://php.net).
However, in the last years more and more frontend development has been added, primarily with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and some [React](https://reactjs.org/) (both [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)).

On the side, I have dealt a lot with server hardware / infrastructure. And I dived more and more into the (Dev)Ops area.
Here, too, I got to know and used many things like: [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ...

I am always eager to embrace new challenges and have a genuine passion for exploring diverse technologies, which has led me to gain extensive experience beyond the technologies mentioned above.

### ðŸŒ± What am I currently doing besides my job?

I'm trying to restart a "old / draft" Go project from scratch with the intention to open source it in longterm.

Otherwise I am improving and expanding my knowledge in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with a few private projects.
